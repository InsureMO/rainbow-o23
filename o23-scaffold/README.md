# o23/scaffold

An `o23`-based scaffold that allows you to quickly build your application. The scaffold includes three parts:

- A very simple pipeline implemented using code and exposed as an API.
- A pipeline based on single table operations implemented using code and exposed as an API. Please note that this pipeline is based on
  `better-sqlite3` and is not suitable for production, it is only intended for demonstration purposes.
- An example of dynamically exposing APIs using pipelines.

These three examples showcase the most basic ways to build with `o23`. You can use them as a foundation to build your own application.
